Agent22260157 Test Reproduction ReadMe

1. Open the BotTester.java file in your preferred editor
2. On line 8, add the four agents to simulate the game with
   to the agents array. This will typically include 3 RandomAgent()
   and one Agent22260157.
3. On line 12, specify the number of games to be played in the
   middle section of the for loop (i.e. where it says i<100).
   The testing shown in the report used 100,000 games, so change
   100 to 100000 if you want to reproduce similar results.
4. On line 14, change the referenced element in the results array
   to the corresponding agent. If you want to see the results of
   the agent in the last position, enter 3. If first, enter 0 etc.
5. Run BotTester.java and the results will be printed in the console.
